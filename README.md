This shows a prview of how an Instagram post would look like using SwiftUI codes. In the future I want to add features that allows user to comment and slid through more pictures.
Only real feature on there right now is the like and save icon will change color when click and the like count will change too.
Credits to people from the IOS app team bootcamp at UNC Chapel Hill for helping me learn the basic on font and Stacks inside SwiftUI. Also credit to ChatGPT for telling how to let icon change colors.
